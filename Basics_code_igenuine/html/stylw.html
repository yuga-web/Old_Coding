<p id="rom">   The original backbone operated at only 56 kbit/s, the maximum speed of a home
dial-up line today. But at the time the primary network traffic was still textual, so this was a
reasonable starting point.Onceoperational,the number of machines connected to NSFNET
grew quickly, in part because the NSF directly or indirectly provided significant support—
both technically and with monetary grants—to educational and research organizations that
wished to connect. The backbone rate was upgraded to 1.5 Mbit/s (T1) in 1988 and then to
45Mbit/s(T3)in1991.Furthermore,the backbone was expanded to directly include several
research networks in addition to the supercomputer centers, making it that much easier for
sites near these research networks to connect to the NSFNET.
